# Convert decimals to roman numerals

###### Written in Rust

## Inspired by [Kevlin Henney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4o0ExLQCs)

The aim of this example was to use lazy iteration to support enormous decimal numbers

### Usage

```$ cargo run <DECIMAL NUMBER>```

### Example

```
~\kata$cargo run 123
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target\debug\kata.exe 123`
CXXIII
```
